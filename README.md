These are my data visualisation projects using Tableau software 

**Superstore Data Analysis is a project based on sales on different items all over the world and getting insights on this data.**

**Data Visualisation:** Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By usingÂ visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, 
visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

**BI Dashboard:** A Business Intelligence dashboard (commonly known as BI dashboard) is used to analyze and visualize information in an actionable way.
Such dashboards can have a lot of different features, mainly having a customizable interface, a certain level of interactivity as well as the possibility to 
data in real-time from multiple sources. By enabling the user to visualize otherwise complex and heavy raw data, they simplify the data processing for our brain 
give readers an at-a-glance overview of the past, current, and future performance.
